You will have to take each person's info to register them. For creating their card number:
1.take first 2 characters from the district name and make it capital letter. Example-from
Dhaka , take DH,
2. From current year pick last two number
3. Concat first two numbers of the user postal number.
4. Add user birthdate 4 digit year
5. After that generate serial number with padding 0 in left from each user
6. Total character length will be 16
Create a function named ‘cardDistribution()’ which will take an array of objects. Each
object will have each person's information. (You must use exact function name, or your
test case may fail)
While distributing sort data alphabetically with fist characters. Sort them with priority
numbers. If the user has priority number 1 will be given first.
If the last number of the card is even, give the user Red Rose , if odd give white Rose.
R = red rose
W = white rose
